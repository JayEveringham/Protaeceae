## Project Overview

This project was undertaken as part of my ongoing IT studies and is based off a fictional genetic engineering company named "Protaeceae". This project aims to create a responsive company portfolio and e-commerce platform that allows users to browse company info, news, research, products, add products to the cart, and proceed to checkout. The design is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, including tablets.
